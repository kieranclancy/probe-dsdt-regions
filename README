WARNING:

This program reads important areas of memory associated with the system's
DSDT (Differentiated System Description Table).

You MUST be sure that the regions specified in the DSDT match the regions
specified in this program, or it will read the wrong areas of memory and may
permanently destroy your machine. (Well, hopefully not, but I won't be
responsible if it does.)

Even if the regions do match the DSDT, there is still a risk that something
can go wrong. I do not recommend modifiying this code to do anything other
than read-only access to memory.
